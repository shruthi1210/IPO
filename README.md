# IPO
All the IPOs that have been released on the Indian Stock Market are visualised and analysed in this project.
An IPO is typically underwritten by one or more investment banks, who also arrange for the shares to be listed on one or more stock exchanges.

Here we have analysed the data to find the degree of correlation between different attributes and also applied various data visualization techniques to study the relation of the month with IPOs launch, top gainers, and top losers at the time of listing.
